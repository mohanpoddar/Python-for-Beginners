# Understanding Variable Identity in Python
"""
Identity of the Variable:
When a variable in python is assigned a value then it is stored inside a memory location. Hence, it referes address in the memory
which does not change once it has been created. This can be checked using the method id(object) 
"""

# Go to the python intrective shell

>>> x = 5		# Variable x with value 5 is stored inside a memory loction with name x.
>>> x
5
>>> id(x)		# Check memory address of an object.
