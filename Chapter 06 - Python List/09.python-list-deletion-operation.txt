# Understanding Python List - list built in functions 

#:------------------------------ pop() ------------------------------:
# pop() - Removes the element from the specified index and also returns the element which was removed.
>>> num = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
>>> print(num)
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
>>>
>>> num.pop(1)                      # Remove element at index 1
20                                  # Returns the deleted element.
>>> print(num)
[10, 30, 40, 50, 60]
>>>
>>>
>>> num.pop()                       # If no index value is provided in pop() , then last statment is deleted.
60
>>> print(num)
[10, 30, 40, 50]
>>>
>>>
>>> x = num.pop(2)                  # Element deleted at index 2 will be returned to 'x'
>>> print(x)
40
>>> print(num)
[10, 30, 50]
>>>
>>> num.pop(-1)                     # Last Element deleted 
50
>>> print(num)
[10, 30]
>>>
>>>
>>> num.pop(-2)                     # 02nd last element is deleted.
10
>>> print(num)
[30]
>>>
>>> num.pop()                       # Single element in the list deleted.
30
>>> print(num)
[]
>>>

#:------------------------------ del statment ------------------------------:
# 'del' statment removes the specified element from the list, but does not return the deleted element.
>>>
>>> num = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 , 45, 50]
>>> print(num)
[5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]
>>>
>>> del num[1]                              # Remove element at index 1 i.e 10
>>> print(num)
[5, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]         
>>>
>>> del num[-2]                             # Remove element at 02nd last index i.e 45 
>>> print(num)
[5, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50]
>>>
>>> del num[2:4]                            # Remove 02nd and 03rd element.
>>> print(num)
[5, 15, 30, 35, 40, 50]
>>>

#:------------------------------ remove () ------------------------------:
# remove() function is used when element to be deleted not the index of the element.
>>> num = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
>>> print(num)
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
>>>
>>> num.remove(8)                           # Element 8 to be deleted. Not the element at index 8
>>> print(num)
[2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
>>>
>>> num.remove(4)                           # Element 4 to be deleted. Not the element at index 4
>>> print(num)
[2, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
>>>
>>> num.remove(3)                           # Runtime error as no element 3 in the list.
